## Concept

## Modules

### Peer to Peer Mode
To run server `python p2p_gameServer -p <port>`
To run client `python p2p_gameClient -p <port>`

### Peer to Peer Mode Test Case
Try starting up the server and connect a number of clients (should support at least 5), once all clients are connected on any one of these clients press the 'p' key to send everyone into peer to peer mode. At this point try stopping the server. The peers should continue to operate together.
